# This is a TODO list right now

## Update stuff for the new multiple cafe runs

* new Gf size plot
  * DONE! The plot is here: `data/CAFE_convergence/significant_orthogroups_from_CAFE.png`

* new correlation with GS and repeats
  * DONE! mean sig GF size is here (`/Users/milena/work/PhD_code/PhD_chapter1/data/uniform_mean_orthogroups_from_CAFE_vs_genome_size.png` with corresponding names for TE correlation)
  * individual sig GF slopes
* new DAVID gene groups --> rename to david gene family cluster for clarity
  * funcional annotation of david gene groups
* new table with all the functional stuff like correlation p-values and slopes and david gene family cluster annotations
* new analysis for all the functional stuff
