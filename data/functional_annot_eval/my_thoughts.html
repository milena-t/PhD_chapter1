            <h1 id="functional-annotation-of-rapidly-evolving-orthogroups">Functional annotation of rapidly evolving orthogroups</h1>
<p>The goal here is to identify interesting functional annotation orthogroups that can be summarized in a table in the main text. Probably like 8-15 or so. Ones that i definitely want to mention:</p>
<ul>
<li>Whatever is going on with the giant ones in A. obtectus</li>
<li>detoxification stuff about cytochrome P450</li>
<li>Some stuff about the genes annotated with sexual reproduction</li>
<li>Some stuff about the olfactory genes</li>
<li>The fluorescence stuff in i. luminosius and the other glowing one</li>
</ul>
<p>Other considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>T. molitor and Z. morio are of particular interest because they are of industrial relevance, both as feed insects for agriculture and exotic pets, and as human food (alternative to other animal proteins). (They also use BRAKER2 and then TSEBRA manually with the default weights!! they also get high gene numbers and lots of single exon genes, especially z. morio)
<ul>
<li>T. molitor RNA: SRR18735292</li>
<li>z. morio RNA: SRR18735291</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I am doing stuff with the table in <code>/PhD_chapter1/src/functional_annotation_eval.py</code>.</p>
<h2 id="large-expansion-in-a-obtectus">large expansion in <em>A. obtectus</em></h2>
<p>A. obtectus has two large orthogroups that are twice as large as the third largest one, N0.HOG0000035 and N0.HOG0000014. The flybase IDs have no functional annotation, and are not associated with any DAVID gene group. The correlation with genome size and repeat content is <em>significant</em> in both cases. Considering that the others are not significant in their association, maybe that's not a biological signal for selection based on function, but instead the expansion is caused by drift through TE activity (and whatever the genome size does)?</p>
<p><img src="file:////Users/milena/work/PhD_chapter1_code/PhD_chapter1/data/functional_annot_eval/Aobt_expansion_GF_sizes.png" alt="A. obtectus expansion" width=45%></p>
<h2 id="detoxification">Detoxification</h2>
<p>Gene Group 1 is the main detoxification group, with all the cytochrome P450 in it, but Gene Group 17 which has aldehyde deoxide in it also has something to do with detoxification. All of these orthogroups are very quiet in <em>Bruchinae</em> and <em>Curculionidae</em> (<em>D. ponderosae</em> and <em>R. ferrugineus</em>). Notable expansions are especially <em>Elateriforma</em> (<em>I. luminosus</em>) which are fluorescent, and <em>Tenebrioids</em>. The two functional anotations in this category are:</p>
<ul>
<li>cytochrome P450 (CYP) is detoxification and we think it could be related to host plant adaptation?</li>
<li>Aldehyde oxidase is a part of the acetaldehyde metabolic process, which breaks down acetaldehyde into less toxic substances</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Tenebrioid</em> insects such as <em>T. molitor</em> and <em>Z. morio</em> can break down plasctics in their gut as larvae. This is possible through specific microorganisms in their gut working together with insect-encoded proteins that are secreted (the degradation rate of isolated microorganisms is significantly lower). <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10924-023-03029-z#Sec11">Source</a> for all that follows. The first step is polyethylene being oxidated by Cytochrome p450 (and others), then more chemistry (involving aldehyde dehydrogenase, which is not the same as aldehyde oxidase!), until it is broken down by lipid metabolism in the cells. According to the flybase annotations, the expression profiles of the Gene Group 1 orthogroups have their peak mostly during larval, and pupae stages, but not exclusively (some are adult sex specific). The differential expression analysis does not provide super strong evidence for CYP though.</p>
<p>Since the lipid metabolism in the cells is the end of the polyethylene breakdown, this gene group is also relevant:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gene Group 3, Function: lipid metabolic process (digestion)</li>
</ul>
<p>
<img src="file:////Users/milena/work/PhD_chapter1_code/PhD_chapter1/data/functional_annot_eval/Gene_Group_3_lipid_metabolism_GF_sizes.png" alt="Gene group 3" width=45%>
</p>
<h3 id="gene-group-1-cytochrome-p450">Gene Group 1: Cytochrome P450</h3>
<p>This gene group is very insignificant for the correlation with both repeat content and genome size. All orthogroups in this gene group are:</p>
<ul>
<li>N0.HOG0000027</li>
<li>N0.HOG0000059</li>
<li>N0.HOG0000095</li>
<li>N0.HOG0000204</li>
<li>N0.HOG0001077</li>
<li>N0.HOG0000140</li>
<li>N0.HOG0000492</li>
<li>N0.HOG0001030</li>
</ul>
<p>This proliferation is unsurprising (expected even?), especially in insects (<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-14-174">source</a>, <em>T. castaneum</em> already has more duplications in the CYP superfamily than <em>B. mori</em> or <em>D. melanogaster</em>). Also detoxification, yes, but they also talk about it in relation to larval development and egg maturation. Some subfamilies (not found as significant here) have also been linked to insecticide resistance in <em>T. castaneum</em></p>
<p>
<img src="file:////Users/milena/work/PhD_chapter1_code/PhD_chapter1/data/functional_annot_eval/Gene_Group_1_detoxofication_GF_sizes.png" alt="Gene group 1" width=45%>
</p>
<h3 id="gene-group-17-aldehyde-oxidase">Gene Group 17: aldehyde oxidase</h3>
<p>This gene group contains only aldehyde oxidase. The only rapidly evolving orthogroup is:</p>
<ul>
<li>N0.HOG0000669
which is insignificant for the correlation with repeat content and also with genome size. It is expressed during all developmental stages and adults of both sexes. There is what seems like a significant expansion in <em>I. luminosus</em>, but <em>I. luminosus</em> has a shit assembly so take that with a grain of salt.</li>
</ul>
<p>

</p>
<p>Aldehyde is a byproduct of alcohol metabolism (in humans?) and is broken down into less toxic molecules by aldehyde oxidase. In insects, aldehyde can come from other sources, such as pheromones, and &quot;<em>Long-chain, unsaturated alcohol and aldehyde compounds arecommon  female-produced  sex  pheromones (REF)</em>&quot; (<a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067794">source</a>). They conclude that &quot;<em>[The] results suggest that an antennae-specific aldehyde oxidasefrom  the  navel  orangeworm,  AtraAOX2,  might  be  involved  indegradation  of  host  plant  volatile  compounds  and  pheromone</em>&quot;, which helps both with distinguishing plant compounds from the pheromones they are actually interested in, and also protects them from volatile plant compounts and potentiallz even pesticides.</p>
<p>Quote from the abstract: &quot;<em>Our data suggest AtraAOX2 might be involved in degradation of a diversity of aldehydes including sex pheromones, plant-derived semiochemicals, and chemical cues for oviposition sites. Additionally, AtraAOX2 could protect the insect's olfactory system from xenobiotics, including pesticides that might reach the sensillar lymph surrounding the olfactory receptor neurons.</em>&quot; (I don't understand the methods or biochemistry in general enough to judge how accurate this is).</p>
<h2 id="sexual-reproduction">Sexual reproduction</h2>
<p>Here, the relevant Gene Groups are these:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gene Group 5, Function: protease inhibitor (immunity, reproduction)</li>
<li>Gene Group 8, Function: immunity and sexual reproduction</li>
<li>Gene Group 9, Function: sexual reproduction</li>
</ul>
<p>Which are these orthogroups (all are unsignificant in GS and TE correlations):</p>
<ul>
<li>N0.HOG0000541 (Gene Group 5,Gene Group 8,Gene Group 25) (15 members in <em>D. melanogaster</em>, otherwise low family size)</li>
<li>N0.HOG0000775 (Gene Group 8) (6 in <em>R. ferrugineus</em>)</li>
<li>N0.HOG0000892 (Gene Group 8) (7 in <em>P. pyralis</em>)</li>
<li>N0.HOG0000401 (Gene Group 9) (21 in <em>Z. morio</em>)</li>
<li>N0.HOG0009002 (Gene Group 9) (4 in <em>I. luminosus</em>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to the detoxification, which means not a lot going on in Bruchinae and Curculionidae, but there's one massively expanding in <em>Z. morio</em> (N0.HOG0000401), whose expression peak is in adult males, and is predicted to be in the ER according to flybase, the molecular function is just protein homodimerization. Otherwise there is not a lot of info, even in <em>D. melanogaster</em>. I have a hard time finding good papers for this based on this extremely vague information.</p>
