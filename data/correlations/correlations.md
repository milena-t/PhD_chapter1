# Correlations of gene family sizes vs. species genome characteristics

We hypothesize that gene families proliferate more in genomes with a high repeat content, because some TEs can facilitate gene duplications. Therefore we calculate the linear regression in each significantly rapidly evolving orthogroup between gene family size and several genome characteristics such as genome size, overall repeat content, and repeat-category content. 

## Method 

### Phylogeneticlaly independent contrasts

I am using my implementation of the phylogenetically independent contrasts according to Felsenstein 1985 and the species tree generated by orthofinder, transformed to be ultrametric with the ape package in R. The code is here: `PhD_chapter1/src/compute_PIC.py`. Both explanatory and response variables are transformed.

### linear regression

I am calculating the linear regression with `scipy.stats.linregress(genome_characteristic, GF_sizes)`. Both variables are log2-transformed to make them more linear
